# Eye Dropper ðŸŽ¨

Eye Dropper is a shader (GDShader) that helps with quick color palette swapping easily customizable through shader parameters.

With this shader, you can configure your palettes through textures or through color arrays, or even use both options, if it's more convenient to you.

This project is fully documented so that you can understand what each function or property does, just check it out in the `eye_dropper.gdshader` file!

To be able to use the palette arrays with various colors, make sure to tweak the `max_palette_array_size` constant in the shader file so that it attends your project's needs. By default it is set to `4`, which means that only `4` colors are allowed at maximum using the arrays, but, as mentioned, that's easily tweakable.

I hope this shader helps you with your project! :D
